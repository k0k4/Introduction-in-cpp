C++ ecersises of the book "Programming - Principles and Practice Using C++" (Bjarne Stroustrup)

I am a computer science student at the TH-KÃ¶ln. To expand my knowledge in object oriented programming, i am using this book from Bjarne Stroustroup. My pourpose is to read and work the book all through to get a good foundation in c++ and the prinicples of OOP.
I know that the exersises i have done are not following the conventions of the book to 100%. That doesn't mean that i don't understand the importance of them.
